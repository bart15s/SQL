How to use sql-2003-2.ebnf
==========================
This file was extracted manually from sql-2003-2.bnf by Domingo Alvarez Duarte.
Many thanx Domingo!

It is the latter file as pure ebnf, i.e. with the original markup stripped.

It can be rendered as railroad diagrams on the website https://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui.
Just copy it into the Edit Grammar tab, and click View Diagram. Then wait a moment :-).

Domingo notes:
1. Non reserved words appear with * as suffix, ex: SUBSTRING -> SUBSTRING*.

2. You can navigate through the grammar by clicking the rectangular boxes.

Finally, you can download the rendered railroad as either XHTML + SVG or HTML + PNG.
